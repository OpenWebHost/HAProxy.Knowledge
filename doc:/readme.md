The complete HAProxy documentation is contained in the following documents.
Please ensure to consult the relevant documentation to save time and to get the
most accurate response to your needs. Also please refrain from sending questions
to the mailing list whose responses are present in these documents.

  - intro.txt (this document) : it presents the basics of load balancing,
    HAProxy as a product, what it does, what it doesn't do, some known traps to
    avoid, some OS-specific limitations, how to get it, how it evolves, how to
    ensure you're running with all known fixes, how to update it, complements
    and alternatives.

  - management.txt : it explains how to start haproxy, how to manage it at
    runtime, how to manage it on multiple nodes, and how to proceed with
    seamless upgrades.

  - configuration.txt : the reference manual details all configuration keywords
    and their options. It is used when a configuration change is needed.

  - coding-style.txt : this is for developers who want to propose some code to
    the project. It explains the style to adopt for the code. It is not very
    strict and not all the code base completely respects it, but contributions
    which diverge too much from it will be rejected.

  - proxy-protocol.txt : this is the de-facto specification of the PROXY
    protocol which is implemented by HAProxy and a number of third party
    products.

  - README : how to build HAProxy from sources
